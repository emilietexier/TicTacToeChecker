# TicTacToeChecker

This is an assignment done as part of the Technical recruitment process at R3.

I was given a challenge: write a game verifier for noughts and crosses.

## Overview

### Noughts and Crosses

This is a two-player game where the players take turns marking the spaces in a 3-by-3 grid with X's and O's.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks (either X's or O's) in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. 
My tasks were as followed :
1. Write a class whose constructor takes in a representation of a 3-by-3 grid with the currently placed marks.
2. Add a function to this class that checks the states of the grid and returns which player has won or if the outcome of the game is yet to be decided. 
3. Document how to build run the code. 

### Code structure

For this assignment, I chose to create a class Grid.java which would be defined by the grid of the game. The grid is directly passed as a parameter in the constructor in order to instanciate the class. 
This class also contains the function which determines which player has won the game or if he outcome of the game is yet to be decided. 

### Data structures

In this assignment, I chose to represent the grid by a 2 dimension array of characters. Indeed,
